            About Cool Runnings Fitness
          </h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Cool Runnings Fitness! We have a passion for runners,
            helping them on their journey and creating a community. CRF is all
            about improving the runner experience, inspiring them to stay
            motivated and live a healthier life.

          <h1>
            Our Story
          </h1>
          <p>
            This website was born from the Cool Runnings Fitness app in 2023,
            but in reality the concept came years before.
          </p>
          <p>
            We noticed the excitement that comes on race day. Some of that
            excitement comes from anticipation. While other times it comes from
            spectators cheering on the runners. An athlete can get a burst of
            energy just by hearing encouraging words from family, friends or
            complete strangers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's be honest, running is challenging and hard to stick to because
            it can be lonely. Most times if you are training for a race or
            trying to stay in shape you are doing it alone. The question became,
            how to get race day encouragement during ever day runs or training
            was asked. The answer came in an app.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the app was in development we wanted a place where runners could
            get more information about running. We also wanted a place where
            runners could be inspired by other runners and keep motivated.
            That's where the Cool Runnings Fitness came in.
          </p>

          <p>
            We hope you will grow with us as we build this running community
          </p>
